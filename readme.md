# Fetch Rewards Take Home Project

## Author

## Description

This project required a sorted list to be displayed to the user. The list needed to be sorted by listId first, and then by item name. Invalid data needed to be filtered out.

To showcase some simple jetpack navigation, I added a simple screen with a button that is tapped to navigate to the screen that displays the list.
